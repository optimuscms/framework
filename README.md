# [WIP] OptimusCMS Framework

This repository will become the monorepo for all the core optimus modules.

It will make it easier to consistently version the packages and improve the testability of unreleased features.

We also plan to subtree the modules into their own read only repositories so they can be used independantly of eachother.
